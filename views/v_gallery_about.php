		<blockquote>"I want my glass to stop conversations, and then provoke discussions."</blockquote>

			<p>â€“ Jim McKelvey</p>


		<h2>For 20 years, James McKelvey has worked to capture the magic of glass in his art. 
			As chairman of the world's largest gathering of glass artists in 2006, he strove to 
			surprise and challenge other artists with his innovative glass faucets. 
			Demand for the faucets proved so strong that McKelvey and a team of artists and 
			engineers spent the next nine months perfecting his design.</h2>

			<p>Creating functional art is a great challenge for an artist/engineer. 
			Each of McKelvey's faucets is shaped by hand from a tube of molten glass. 
			For every four attempts, only one faucet is accepted. It is then cut, polished, 
			tempered, and assembled using materials so pure that the FDA approves them for 
			implantation into the body.
