Project 4 for CSCI E-15

Description:
This project is a remake of a friend's website, www.glassfaucet.com. The current site needed
an update both in terms of functionality and design. The site is not an e-commerce site - 
each glass piece is one-of-a-kind and rather expensive. The owner therefore prefers a site 
where the customer can look at the items and then email the artist about any item they were interested in.

Features:
* customer sign up, login and log out
* an email is sent to customer when signing up
* customers can favorite items when logged in (and un-favorite items)
* the gallery can be filtered on four different criteria
* email regarding interest in item can be sent to admin from customer
* customers can delete their account
* superuser (admin/owner of the site) can upload new items via web
* superuser can delete products from gallery (database)

JavaScript:
- Start site image and text fade in / fade out
- Left side filter options toggle and gallery filtering
- filter reset
- Navigation link color change on active site
- favorite/un-favorite symbols appearing on mouseover
- "number of items"-header shown in gallery
- email sent confirmation (when contacting gallery via site)

Additional info:
